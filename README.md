## FAQs

### What if I reopen a tab? Will my old Trail still be there?
Currently, each session is saved only while the tab is open. Once a tab is closed, its Trail is cleared. This feature helps keep your browsing history streamlined and focused on your current sessions.

### Can I save my Trails permanently?
At the moment, TrailBlazer focuses on organizing active sessions. For future updates, weâ€™re considering options to save or export Trails for long-term storage.
